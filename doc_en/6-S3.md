# 🗃️ Amazon S3 (Backups)

This section describes how Amazon S3 was used to store manual backups of the SQL Server database and other data from the environment. It provides a basic cloud-based storage layer that is accessible from internal resources without exposing them to the internet.

> ⚠️ All actions were performed within an AWS Academy lab environment, which limits automation, lifecycle policies, and IAM roles. Backups were done manually, and access was configured to work securely from private subnets using an S3 Gateway endpoint.

---

## 🧭 Context and Objectives

Due to lab restrictions, full automated backup solutions were not feasible. Instead, the goal was to:

- Create a private and secure location to store `.sql` backup files
- Ensure internal services like RDS or Windows Server can upload backups
- Avoid any public access or exposure to the internet
- Simulate a scalable backup strategy in a hybrid cloud setup

---

## 🗂️ Bucket Configuration

1. **Created a new S3 bucket** in the same region as the VPC
   - Name: `company-backups` (or similar)
   - Blocked all public access (default)
   - Versioning: Disabled (not required for manual backups)
   - Encryption: Not applied (not available in lab)

2. **Created folders inside the bucket** for organization:
   - `/sql_backups/`
   - `/manual_exports/`

3. **Naming convention for backup files**:
   - `backup_bdsistematix_DD_MM_YYYY.sql`
   - Example: `backup_bdsistematix_10_04_2024.sql`

## 🔐 Private Access via S3 Gateway

To enable access from private subnets (e.g. Windows Server or Bastion), an **S3 Gateway Endpoint** was used:

1. **Created a Gateway Endpoint** in the VPC
   - Service: `com.amazonaws.<region>.s3`
   - Route tables: Associated with all private subnets

2. **Result**: Windows Server in the private subnet could upload backups directly to S3 **without internet access**.

> 🛡️ This is a secure and cost-effective way to allow internal resources to interact with S3.

---

## ✅ Outcome

- Backups were uploaded successfully from Bastion and Windows Server
- Files stored privately in a secure S3 bucket
- Public access fully disabled
- Demonstrated how hybrid environments can leverage S3 without NAT or internet gateways
